# Cheesy Math

The goal of this project is to determine how much the quality of performance of the human brain to solve easy math problems will differ when individuals are only focusing on solving math puzzles, as opposed to when they are playing a video game. We also consider another criterion, which is the interaction errors between the two players. To achieve this, we have developed a runner game in which the character (Mousy) will be controlled by two players. During the game, they must collect as much cheese as they can and also answer all the math puzzles. After conducting the experiments, we will report the error rates based on the players' performances. The idea will be discussed in detail in the following sections.
