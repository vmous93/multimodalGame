# Cheesy Math

The goal of this project is to determine how much the quality of performance of the human brain to solve easy math problems will differ when individuals are only focusing on solving math puzzles, as opposed to when they are playing a video game. We also consider another criterion, which is the interaction errors between the two players. To achieve this, we have developed a runner game in which the character (Mousy) will be controlled by two players. During the game, they must collect as much cheese as they can and also answer all the math puzzles. After conducting the experiments, we will report the error rates based on the players' performances. The idea will be discussed in detail in the following sections.


## Research Question

**How does playing video games affect human brain performance in solving easy math problems?**

We ask one of the players to answer 10 math questions within 1 minute (6 seconds for each question) before the game. Then, during the game, they have to answer similar questions, allowing us to measure the differences in their math-solving performance.

Also, During the game, a supervisor annotates the answers of player one (who can see the screen and, by giving commands to player two, attempts to answer the questions). In this case, we can monitor the errors caused by the interaction problem between the two players.


## Modalities

**Input:** Movement(Smarphone Motion Sensor), Touch(Laptop touchpad), Hear Rate(Bitalino)

**Output:** Sound, Vibration


## Emotional Model

Flow: Change the speed of the character based on the heart rate(HR) changes.
